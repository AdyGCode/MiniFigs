## About Minifigs

Minifigs is a demonstration application used for teaching how to create and maintain a 
Laravel based application. 

## Concept

Minifigs is a small application that hosts and maintains a database of Lego Minifigs. 
There are a few caveats that form a part of the development.

The application allows users to register, reset passwords, search, add, edit and remove
 minifigs from the system. It also allows the users to register the number of each Minifig
 they have or  wish to have. 

## Core Purpose

The core purpose of this base code is for teaching. 

The core code will provide a skeleton application that learners will expand upon as they
 learn about features and capabilities of the Laravel platform.

During the learning and development, features will be added or be required to be constructed, 
that may include, but are not limited to:
 
* Series migration, and then creation of BREAD functionality
* Users migration, BREAD, password reset, log-in, log-out
* Minifigs migration, BREAD operations
* Owned MiniFigs migration, BREAD operations
